                    <p>Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming increasingly popular. In 2015, collegiate hackathons alone attracted over 54,000 participants across 150 events. While "hackathons", that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims: 

                    "sprints" bring together existing communities to advance planned work, 
                    "codefests" bring together related communities to encourage interoperability, 
                    "hack-days" and "hack-weeks" teach hacking and making skills to diverse audiences without software backgrounds, like artists and scientists,
                    "edit-a-thons" support intensive co-generation of encyclopedia content, and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. </p>

                    <p>This <strong>one-day workshop</strong> will bring together:</p>
                     <ul class="overviewlist">
                         <li> researchers interested in the phenomenon, </li>
                         <li> experienced event organizers, and </li>
                         <li> participants interested in running their own events. </li>
                     </ul>
                      <p> The workshop aims to facilitate consolidating existing research, sharing practical experiences, and understanding what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.</p>

                        <li><strong>Design variations:</strong> What are the different variations in event design?

                        <li><strong>Short-term and long-term outcomes:</strong> How do event goals vary across different contexts and designs? How do we measure success in achieving these goals? How do we support more long-term outcomes, such as encouraging sustained participation and continued community development post-event?</li>
                        <li><strong>Practical support for event organizers:</strong> Designing supporting tools and workflows for hackathon organizers and community managers to leverage, such as instruments to evaluate outcomes and assess community needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Applications of hackathon-style events to non-traditional contexts (such as, but not limited
                        to, learning environments and/or non-software engineering work), reports of both successes and lessons learned</li>

                        <li><strong>Theoretical space of ‘hackathons’:</strong> Building theory around the ecology and etymology of ‘hacking’ to support a more generalized understanding of the opportunities for collaborative work, e.g. what is the boundary space for events to be considered “hackathons”, what are related activities that go by different names (e.g. Codefests, Sprints), how are they connected, and where does the family of events fit within the broader space of CSCW?</li>
